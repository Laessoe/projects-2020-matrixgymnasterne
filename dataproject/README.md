# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Exchange rates and GDP growth** and is about the correlation between exchange rates (in relation to USD) and GDP growth across different countries.

In the project two datasets are loaded:

1. VALUTAKURSER.xls downloaded from data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF
1. BNPVÃ†KST.xls downloaded from data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.kd.zg

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``

``pip install pandas_datareader``


**Findings:**
Exchange rates depend on many factors, yet there seems to be some correlation with GDP growth. Some exchange rates are more volatile than others and generally the correlation differs for each country since they all have different charactaristics.
